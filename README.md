### Summary

This assignment was challenging and I appreciate the time invested by everyone who designed this challenge. 

I have tried to solve this with full capacity, but couldn't succeed in the first attempt. There is no point to make excuse about this.

I believe this shouldn't stop you from looking at my approach and code style.

### My Approach

1. I have created a fake data set in `data.js`
2. I have designed the JSON in such a way that you can mentally visual the complete hierarchy.
3. `index.js` is my main file where I wrote the implementation. I started with recursion and created cards. 
4. Now the main hurdle for me is to build the parent-child relationship with these rows and their cards.
